## Task summary

_See [the rubric](https://parsertongue.org/courses/snlp-2/assignments/rubrics/class-competition/final/#task-summary)_

The goal of this task is to see if two texts are by the same or different authors.  First task was to examine the datasets and read them into a dataframe.

The first thing I tried was to find cosine similarity, but that performed awfully. I was going to try word embeddings but after looking at the data, it wasn't necesarily the _words_ that made them same authors, but other features.

So, to be brief and not give away my competitive edge 😏 I ended up following some guides from HuggingFace to run a Sequence Classifier model and using Transformer tokenizers to encode the text. 

I chose Sequence Classifier because because a sequence2sequence based model is more effective then logistic regression and uses attention mechanisms to better find the important features to tell the differences.

In terms of tokenizers, I chose my specific tokenizer I did because it is considered leading in tokenizers and was suggested for text classification.

My next move will be to add more augmented data to better train the model and mess around with parameters and maybe different pre-trained models.
