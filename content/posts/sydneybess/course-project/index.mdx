## Project description

_See [the rubric](https://parsertongue.org/courses/snlp-2/assignments/rubrics/course-project/final/#reproducibility).  Use subsections to organize components of the description._

Draft summary:

For this project I am trying to do Optical Character Recognition on typed resources (old and typewritten, scanned documents) in Coeur d'Alene (CdA). The documents are written in a sort of phonetic transcription with lots of accents.
But the goal is we want to be able to extract the text, make it searchable, and able to be put into a database. First we have to extract it which I'm using transformers and synthetic data.
--- 
**Goal 1 (Nov 17)**: Create the synthetic data  ✅ [You can see some which I generated](https://github.com/uazhlt-ms-program/ling-582-fall-2025-course-project-code-indigenous-language-ocr/tree/main/gen-samples)

  Tools I'll be using:
  * Markovify (create made up words)
  * Pillow (generate the images)
  * Augraphy (for photo augmentation)
--- 
**Goal 2 (Nov 24)**: Create the model and train on synthetic data to perform OCR on new sources 👩‍💻  [You can see what I have so far](https://github.com/uazhlt-ms-program/ling-582-fall-2025-course-project-code-indigenous-language-ocr/blob/main/current_scripts/current_model.ipynb)

Tools I'll be using:
* TrOCR
* Transformers
---
**Goal 3 (Nov 28)**: Improve the model and start working on layout parsing to seperate the English from the CdA and run the respective OCR models. 
Because TrOCR doesn't do full pdf's, I'll also have to use a tool to split into parts along with splitting by language 

Tools I'll be using:
  * Maybe use PyTesseract to create line boundary boxes and filter even and odds to English or CdA and then save them as individual pictures and run through base and modified models
---
**Goal 4 (Dec 5)**: Have performed testing using the layout parsing and gotten good results

---
**Goal 5 (Dec 7)**: Completed blog post and finalized code
