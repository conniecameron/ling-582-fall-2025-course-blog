## Task summary

My baseline approach treats the problem as a style-similarity classification task. I split each input text on the [SNIPPET] delimiter to isolate the two spans and represent each span using character-level n-gram TF-IDF features, since character patterns capture author-specific habits better than word-level signals. I then compute the absolute difference between the two vector representations and train a LinearSVC classifier with class-balanced weights on this feature space. For the final version of the project, I plan to tune the SVM’s regularization parameter with cross-validation, add stylometric features such as punctuation frequency and length ratios, and test lightweight embedding models to better capture deeper stylistic similarities between spans. This gives me a clear path for improving both stability and macro F1 performance over the baseline.
