## Description

Using images to achieve a multimodal approach, the authors of this paper tackle the challenge of capturing idiomatic representation in both English and Brazilian Portuguese. They did this in a 3-step approach: A) idiom detection, B) literal meaning generation of the idiomatic nominal compound (NC), and C) aligning images that best correspond to the intended interpretation of the NC. For Portuguese, they took a slightly different approach and tested two methods. In the first, once the idiom detection stage was completed, they translated the NC to English. In the second, the NC was not translated and the authors used multilingual multimodal image alignment models that could process multiple languages. The best results were achieved using model ensembling for both languages and Portuguese performed better without translation to English.

## Motivation

I think idioms are really interesting and am curious about the different approaches used to disambiguate their meanings.
