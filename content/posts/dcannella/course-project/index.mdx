## Project description

Automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems&mdash;such as those used in voice assistants, captioning, and accessibility tools&mdash;are known to perform significantly worse for individuals with speech disabilities, including dysarthria, stuttering, apraxia, and other motor-speech disorders. This performance discrepancy limits the inclusiveness of voice-driven technologies. This project aims to quantify ASR bias against speakers with speech disabilities and explore fine-tuning strategies that improve recognition accuracy.

The goals for this project are:
* Benchmark baseline ASR performance on typical vs. atypical speech.
* Fine-tune the open-source ASR model Wave2Vec2 on speech-disability datasets.
* Measure improvements in Word Error Rate (WER) on impaired-speech test sets.
* Analyze which disability types or acoustic characteristics see the most improvement.

    <tr>
      <th>Week 1</th>
      <td>Evaluate typical and atypical speech with Wav2Vec2 and record baseline WER differences.</td>

    <tr>
      <th>Week 2</th>
      <td>Preprocess the audio in the datasets using Libroso and fine-tune the speech model using TORGO (dysarthric speech) and SEP-28k (stuttering).</td>
