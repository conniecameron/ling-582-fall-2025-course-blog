## Description
My approach can be summarized as  I split each pair of text snippets, extracted detailed stylometric and n-gram features, compared the two snippets using difference-based metrics, trained three different models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting), combined them with a weighted ensemble, tuned the decision threshold, and used this optimized ensemble to generate the final predictions.
