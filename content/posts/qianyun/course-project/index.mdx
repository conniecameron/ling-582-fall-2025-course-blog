## Project description

This project will evaluate how well vision-language models capture statistical patterns in time-series data through natural-language output.

My dataset begins with a publicly available historical stock-price dataset from Kaggle (“Stock Market Stars: Historical Data of Top 10 Companies”).
The original dataset contains numerical columns (Date, Open, High, Low, Close, Volume).

To convert this into a multimodal dataset, I generated line-chart images using sliding windows (10–20 days) for each company.
Each chart is paired with a heuristic caption describing the trend (e.g., “strong upward trend,” “high volatility”).

This transforms a purely tabular dataset into a custom multimodal corpus suitable for chart-captioning fine-tuning.

The goals for my course project are:

1. Fine-tune multimodal models (BLIP / BLIP-2) to generate captions describing chart movements.
2. Evaluate the model’s caption quality.
3. Analyze what types of trends the model recognizes well vs. poorly.
