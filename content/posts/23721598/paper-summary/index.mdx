## Description

This paper presents a new approach that allows models to interpret natural-language time expressions more accurately. Traditional methods often struggle with complex or ambiguous temporal phrases, and although large language models are powerful, they can still be inconsistent when handling time expressions.

The key idea of this paper is to convert each time expression into an executable “time python program” using a framework called Semantically Compositional Annotation of Temporal Expressions (SCATE). This paper uses an LLM to generate SCATE code for many sentences and automatically filters out errors by executing the code, which produces a high-quality set of synthetic training data. It then combines this synthetic data with existing human-annotated data to train a much smaller model. Experiments show that the resulting small model ultimately outperforms the large language model on the time-normalization task.

## Motivation

I selected this paper because:
- Time expressions are important in many NLP tasks (e.g., event extraction, QA, clinical NLP), yet accurate time normalization is still a hard problem.
- This paper introduces a structured and interpretable approach using the SCATE framework.
- This paper proposes a novel use of LLMs to generate semantic training data and train a smaller, more reliable model.
- As a recent NeurIPS 2025 accepted paper, the work is high-quality and solid.
