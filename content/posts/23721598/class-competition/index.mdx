## Description of my preliminary approach
My current approach uses sentence-level embeddings and a gradient boosting classifier.
- First of all, I split each input pair on the [SNIPPET] delimiter to obtain two separate text segments.
- Encode both segments using the all-mpnet-base-v2 SentenceTransformer model.
- I construct contrastive features, including absolute difference, elementwise product, and cosine similarity between embeddings.
- Then I train a LightGBM binary classifier using these features.

## Planned improvements
- Try to add some features.
- Experimenting with additional models.
