## Approach

# Draft Approach 

My approach can be summarized as splitting the sentences based on the delimiter [SNIPPET] and finding word embedding to the sentences. Then used cosine similarity to find similarity between the sentences. Used this similarity score and labels to train model. Also, converted the test file to embeddings, calculated similarity score and used to evaluate the model. My further approach is to try with different transformers for the embeddings and tune the model to improve accuracy."
