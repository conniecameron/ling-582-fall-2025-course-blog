## Description

_This paper is a survey of existing research on using Large Language Models for studying Lexical Semantic Change (LSC). Lexical Semantic Change is the shift in meaning of a given word over time, and the paper outlines various approaches that have been developed to use LLMs to measure this change. Additionally, the paper groups existing approaches for using LLMs on LSC problems based on what type of linguistic change is being detected, as well as by form-based, sense-based, and ensemble-based approaches._

## Motivation

_I selected this paper because I am using NLP techniques to study measurable cultural shifts in language over time and I am interested in trying to determine if one of the methods described in this survey will be suitable for my research._
