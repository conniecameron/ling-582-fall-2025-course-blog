## Description
The paper investigates how Large Language Models (LLMs) 
can be prompted to perform reasoning without 
any few-shot examples.
By introducing a simple cue&mdash;“Let’s think step by step”&mdash;the authors show that 
LLMs can generate coherent intermediate reasoning in a purely zero-shot setting. 
Through a series of experiments and comparisons against few-shot prompting, 
the paper demonstrates that this cueing is often sufficient 
to turn LLMs into effective _zero-shot reasoners_.


## Motivation

The motivation for selecting this paper is that it connects 
directly to the course project and uncovers a previously 
underexplored capability of LLMs&emdash;zero-shot reasoning.
It also demonstrates a practical way to access the 
parametric knowledge LLMs acquire during training 
using simple prompts.
