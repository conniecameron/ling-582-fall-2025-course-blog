# Class Competition — Initial Draft Report  
*Student:* Pranitha Chilvari 
*Team:* Data Minds

## Task Overview
The shared task for this competition involves examining two text sections joined by the token [SNIPPET] and predicting whether they were written by the *same author (1)* or by *different authors (0)*.  
This problem is treated as a *binary classification* challenge focused on authorship attribution.

The dataset includes three files:
- train.csv — labeled examples  
- test.csv — unlabeled evaluation set  
- sample_submission.csv — output template to follow  

Each entry contains an *ID, the combined **TEXT, and a **LABEL* in the training data.

## Team Baseline Approach
Our team worked together to build an initial baseline system.  
The model training and prediction process was carried out in a *shared Kaggle notebook*, which allowed easy upload of data and reproducible execution.

### Key steps in our baseline:
1. Uploaded all CSV files to Kaggle.  
2. Loaded the data using pandas.  
3. Developed features using *TF–IDF*, applying:  
   - word n-grams (1–2)  
   - character n-grams (3–5)  
4. Trained a *Logistic Regression* classifier with balanced class weights.  
5. Performed a small validation split to estimate performance.  
6. Retrained the model using the complete training data.  
7. Generated predictions for the test data and saved them as submission.csv.

This file was then used for our first submission to the leaderboard.
