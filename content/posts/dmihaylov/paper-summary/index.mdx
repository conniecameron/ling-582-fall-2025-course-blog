## Description

_In your own words, what is this paper about?_
<p>The paper I have chosen utilized BERTopic, a modern NLP topic-modeling method, to 42,422 traumatic brain injury (TBI) research articles published starting from 1990. The authors extracted 27 data-driven research themes and used linear regression trend analyses to statistically distinguish "hot" and "cold" research topics in TBI. The paper demonstrates how NLP and statistical modeling can uncover shifts in scientific focus across decades of literature with less of a reliance on human review.</p>

## Motivation

_Why did you select this paper?_
< !-- NOTE: don't use an LLM to generate this! 🙃 -->
<p>I selected this paper because of ongoing research I am a part of which is related to TBI and language production. I figured I would be able to learn and draw from this paper to be able to apply an NLP approach to my personal research. Additionally, I have a huge interest in neuro and cognitive-related analyses that utilize NLP approaches.</p>
