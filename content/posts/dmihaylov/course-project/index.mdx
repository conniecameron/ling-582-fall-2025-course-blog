## Project description

_See [the rubric](https://parsertongue.org/courses/snlp-2/assignments/rubrics/course-project/final/#reproducibility).  Use subsections to organize components of the description._

<p>For my class project, my plan is to build and evaluate a statistical classifier that can distinguish human-written text from text generated by LLM's, using only measurable linguistic and probabilistic features. My aim is to collect a balanced dataset of human and model-generated samples, to then extract features such as type-token ratio, Zipf distribution fit, and POS-tag entropy (via an n-gram model and a small pretrained language model), and use these features as input to an interpretable classifier like logistic regression or a random forest (taken from prior classes of the HLT program so far). The larger goal is to see which statistical signals still separate human and LLM writing, and whether these traditional NLP methods remain viable as quality/complexity increase overtime. The final deliverables will include the trained model, quantitative evaluation, feature importance analysis, and an interpretation of my results along with future improvements.</p>
<p>11/3–11/10: Collect human and LLM-generated text
11/11–11/17: Extract statistical features and build baseline classifier
11/18–11/30: Run experiments and evaluate feature importance/performance
12/1–12/7: Final analysis and write-up </p>
