## Description

*Initial At-a-Glance Mid-Semester Summary*

_This paper is about the challenges facing people doing NLP work in Indonesia, due to its unique environment of myriad languages and dialects, code-mixing, and underresourced language groups and analysis.  This paper evaluates those challenges, shows strengths and weaknesses of current models (even among specific dialects of the same language), and proposes solutions to lighten the load on computational linguists going forward when doing NLP work in order to both maximize human and computational efficiency._

## Motivation

_Why did you select this paper?_
I chose this paper because:
* The essay is applicable to me (as I plan to do work over in Indonesia long-term)
* The data analysis of how certain models vary in effectiveness *even amongst dialects within language groups near each other* demonstrates the practical challenges of applying what we are learning in this course
* Despite Indonesia being the fourth most populous country in the world and one of the most linguistically dense, this essay analyzes the specific challenges that have resulted in this being one of the hardest to tackle areas for many computational linguists
* I think the topic is neat :)
