## Project description

Project Approach 
Outline of Goals
  identify an indigenous language family of the Americas with sufficient documentation for project
  train a system/model that can identify the language of a given text. This will require a sample text of each language. Ideally multiple pages of text, but at least a few hundred words.
  After training, the model will identify the language of a given text. The text will need to be a minimum length, potentially 10 words/2-3 sentences.
  Aim for a minimum of 3 languages to differentiate. Ideally have 5+ languages to expand usability of the model
  If possible, outline an approach for training more languages in the future
Training approach 
  train model by identifying key statistics of sample text for each language.
  average word length
  unique characters
  unique vocabulary
  general word order (would first require POS tagging)
  create an algorithm that combines these factors and outputs a guess with a percentage
    i.e. “Language A, 85% likely”, “Language C, 34% likely”
    include a message if the percentage is too low, under 50%?
      i.e. “Unable to make a reliable estimate. Try again with a longer text.”
  potential language families:
    iroquoian (NE U.S.)
      https://library.si.edu/digital-library/book/hymnalinsenecala00bata
    Cherokee
      https://language.cherokee.org/learning-materials/
Timeline
  Week 0 (11/16: Approach Due)
    identify language family
    identify potential computing approaches
    submit project approach
  Week 0.5 (11/19)
    gather sample texts, clean them, add to database for testing
    create initial code for testing and training
    identify more feasible approaches based on initial coding
  Week 1 (11/23)
    refine testing and identify major issues to be addressed
    seek feedback for additional testing approaches if necessary
    build up database with additional texts if necessary
    code rough output messages based on results
  Week 1.5 (11/26)
    work out bugs in model to improve accuracy
    establish minimum text length that would be feasible for identification
  Week 2 (11/30)
    continue coding
    identify additional languages to train if model is working well at this point
    less work completed in this timeframe due to Thanksgiving Break
  Week 2.5 (12/3)
    begin training of additional languages, if possible
    work on write up of project summary, individual contributions, etc.
    begin analyzing results, limitations, future improvements, etc.
  week 3 (12/7) PROJECT DUE!
    make final touches on model
    organize code and resources, create READEME.md file and put in-line comments, for easy understanding on grader side
    finish write-up and discussion
