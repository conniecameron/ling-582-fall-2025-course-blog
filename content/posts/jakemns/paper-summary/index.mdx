## Description

This paper analyzes current models' ability to process idiomatic expressions, measuring Affinity and Scaled Similarity.
The authors found that current models are lacking in this area, and they explore the limitations that currently exist.

## Motivation

_Why did you select this paper?_
I love the concept of idioms in general in linguistics and am interested in reading more about it. I think that this
phenomenon is particularly interested in the lense of ML.
