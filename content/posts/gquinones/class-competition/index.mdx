## Approach

_See [the rubric](https://parsertongue.org/courses/snlp-2/assignments/rubrics/class-competition/final/#approach)_

To identify which texts were written by the same author and which were not, I decided to create a TD-IDF vector. Here, I focused on both unigrams and biagrams (`ngram_range=(1,2)`). I also made sure that the code focuses on the most common terms in the text, so any words that appear less than 20% of the document were eliminated (`min_df=.2`). All of these features were put into place with the TEXT column of the *train.csv* file, which has been given the variable *dataset*.

Since the TD-IDF vector divides the terms of the TEXT column into numerical features, I created a data frame to visualize what was happening. Also, in that code, I made sure that the matrix was storing all of the values that it found within the 20% filter. 

Then, I made sure with all of the values and data that have been created, I split the training data into both training and testing data. I made sure that 80% of the data was for training and the remaining 20% was for testing. Due to the TD-IDF, I decided to train a Logistical Regression classifier to identify which text were written by the same author. From there, I tested this on the test set I created from the train.csv file. 

From there, I used the created codes to predict labels of the TEXT column of the test data frame using the trained model.
