## Project description

_See [the rubric](https://parsertongue.org/courses/snlp-2/assignments/rubrics/course-project/final/#reproducibility).  Use subsections to organize components of the description._

Project Approach - Jake Mains and Gabriela Quiñones
  - Outline of Goals
    - Identify an indigenous language family of the Americas with sufficient documentation for project
    -Train a system/model that can identify the language of a given text. This will require a sample text of each language. Ideally multiple pages of text, but at least a few hundred words.
    - After training, the model will identify the language of a given text. The text will need to be a minimum length, potentially 10 words/2-3 sentences.
    - Aim for a minimum of 3 languages to differentiate. Ideally have 5+ languages to expand usability of the model
    - If possible, outline an approach for training more languages in the future
- Training approach 
    - Train model by identifying key statistics of sample text for each language.
        - Average word length
        - Unique characters
        - Unique vocabulary
        - General word order (would first require POS tagging)
    - Create an algorithm that combines these factors and outputs a guess with a percentage
        - i.e. “Language A, 85% likely”, “Language C, 34% likely”
        - Include a message if the percentage is too low, under 50%?
            - i.e. “Unable to make a reliable estimate. Try again with a longer text.”
    - Potential language families:
        - Iroquoian (NE U.S.)
            - (https://library.si.edu/digital-library/book/hymnalinsenecala00bata)
        - Cherokee
            - (https://language.cherokee.org/learning-materials/)
    - Timeline
        - Week 0 (11/16: Approach Due)
            - Identify language family
            - Identify potential computing approaches
            - Submit project approach
        - Week 0.5 (11/19)
            - Gather sample texts, clean them, add to database for testing
            - Create initial code for testing and training
            - Identify more feasible approaches based on initial coding
        - Week 1 (11/23)
            - Refine testing and identify major issues to be addressed
            - Seek feedback for additional testing approaches if necessary
            - Build up database with additional texts if necessary
            - Code rough output messages based on results
        - Week 1.5 (11/26)
            - Work out bugs in model to improve accuracy
            - Establish minimum text length that would be feasible for identification
        - Week 2 (11/30)
            - Continue coding
            - Identify additional languages to train if model is working well at this point
            - Less work completed in this timeframe due to Thanksgiving Break
        - Week 2.5 (12/3)
            - Begin training of additional languages, if possible
            - Work on write up of project summary, individual contributions, etc.
            - Begin analyzing results, limitations, future improvements, etc.
        - Week 3 (12/7) PROJECT DUE!
            - Make final touches on model
            - Organize code and resources, create READEME.md file and put in-line comments, for easy understanding on grader side
            - Finish write-up and discussion
