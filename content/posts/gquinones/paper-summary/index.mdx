## Description

_In your own words, what is this paper about?_

This paper seeks to find out if a translation done with an AI system like GPT-4o has a distinct style that can be identifiable by using stylometry. This way, they could see if the translations done by AI can be identified and differentiated from translation done by professional translators. To do so, the researchers decided to test this by translating religious documents from Arabic to English. After getting the translated texts from both AI and the translators, the researchers found that the translations generated by GPT-4o demonstrate a distinctive style that can be used as indicators of AI generated translations. With the researchers noticing that this text had a type of formulaic approach, taking into account the frequency of the words and the number of stop words used. 

## Motivation

_Why did you select this paper?_
< !-- NOTE: don't use an LLM to generate this! 🙃 -->

This paper was selected because it aligns with my own personal interest on Stylometry. I’m always open to learn more about the different ways that Stylometry can be used. Seeing how this paper used it to identify if a text was translated by humans or by AI piqued my interest. Also, this paper explores just how well Open AI’s GPT-4o is for translating texts from one language to another, which I was very curious to learn more about. I wanted to learn if GPT 4o would do an adequate translation and how it would compare to a translation done by experts in the field.
