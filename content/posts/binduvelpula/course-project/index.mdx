## Project description

#Project Title:

Hybrid Stylometry + Transformer Model for Authorship Verification

#Goals of Final Project:

- Build an authorship verification system using a combination of stylometric features and transformer embeddings.
- Extract stylometric features such as lexical richness, punctuation patterns, character frequency, and syntactic complexity.
- Generate dense text embeddings using a pre-trained transformer model (Sentence-BERT).
- Combine stylometric + transformer vectors into a single fused representation.
- Train and compare multiple classifiers (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, MLP).
- Evaluate models using accuracy, macro F1, micro F1, and confusion matrix.
- Analyze which features help most in verifying if two text snippets are written by the same author.

#Rough Timeline
- Week 1 (Oct 27 – Oct 31)
  Explore project ideas
  Review literature on stylometry and authorship verification
  Select project topic
- Week 2 (Nov 3 – Nov 7)
  Define goals and pipeline
  Choose transformer model (MiniLM / SBERT)
  Explore feature extraction libraries (spaCy, NLTK, textstat)
- Week 3 (Nov 10 – Nov 14)
  Implement stylometric feature extraction
  Generate transformer embeddings
  Build baseline model (stylometry only)
  Test initial results
- Week 4 (Nov 17 – Nov 21)
  Fuse stylometric + transformer representations
  Train classifier models
  Perform hyperparameter tuning
  Evaluate performance
- Week 5 (Nov 24 – Nov 28)
  Complete all experiments
  Run metrics + EDA
  Document results and graphs
  Write summary & interpretation
- Week 6 (Dec 1 – Dec 5)
  Finalize report
  Clean code and prepare reproducibility checklist
  Push final project to GitHub
  Submit final blog post
