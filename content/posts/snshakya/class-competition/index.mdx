## Task summary

## Exploratory data analysis

_See [the rubric](https://parsertongue.org/courses/snlp-2/assignments/rubrics/class-competition/final/#exploratory-data-analysis)_

## Approach

I started with a simple logistic regression model using only character TF-IDF cosine similarity. To improve performance, I added word TF-IDF similarity, Jaccard token overlap, and a set of writing features (token length, type–token ratio, punctuation ratio, etc.), encoded as pairwise absolute differences and ratios. This achieved ~0.59. I then replaced logistic regression with a Linear SVM . This feature-engineered SVM approach achieved a  higher macro-F1 (~0.63) on Kaggle.
