## Description

<p>This paper studies how the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP) has changed over many years. The authors collected around 80,000 research papers from the ACL Anthology, which is a large online library for NLP research. They used computer programs to read these papers and automatically group them into different categories, such as “language resources,” “text generation,” “applications,” and “linguistic analysis.”</p>
<p>After grouping the papers, they looked at how often each topic appeared across different years. They found that some topics became very popular over time, especially deep learning, transformer models, and text generation. Other areas, like old rule-based methods, became less common. They also saw that most research focuses on English, while many low-resource languages are rarely studied. The paper explains that important areas like fairness, ethics, and multimodal research still need more attention.</p>

## Motivation

_Why did you select this paper?_

<p>I chose this paper because it helps me understand the big picture of NLP. The field grows very fast, and new papers come out almost every day. Sometimes it is hard to know what topics are popular, what topics are fading away, and what areas still need more research. This paper answers those questions by giving a clear overview of the whole field.</p>
<p>Another reason I picked this paper is that it uses statistics and data analysis, which fits very well with a statistical NLP course. Instead of focusing on one small task, it analyzes a huge number of papers and shows patterns over time. I find this very helpful because it teaches me how to think about research at a larger scale.</p>
<p>This paper also connects to my own interests. I want to learn more about low-resource languages, fairness, and new research directions. The authors show that these areas are still under-studied, which motivates me to explore them more. This paper will also be useful when I write future project proposals, because it helps me explain why a topic is important or why it has not been fully explored yet.</p>
