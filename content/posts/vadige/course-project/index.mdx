## Overview

For my course project, our team of two will compare the capabilities of open-source decoder-only LLMs (GPT-2, GPT-NeoX, Llama-2-7B) on creative text generation tasks. We will use a shared prompt set and evaluate the models qualitatively.

## Goals

- Compare fluency, coherence, creativity across models  
- Identify strengths and weaknesses  
- Observe hallucinations, repetition, and bias  
- Create a small evaluation dataset and analysis

## Method

1. Create a prompt set (12–15 prompts)  
2. Generate outputs using hosted model demos  
3. Keep generation settings consistent  
4. Evaluate:
   - Fluency  
   - Coherence  
   - Creativity  
   - Factuality  
   - Bias/toxicity  
5. Organize side-by-side comparisons

## Timeline (starting Nov 17)

- **Nov 17–20:** Finalize prompts + model list  
- **Nov 21–26:** Collect outputs from each model  
- **Nov 27–Dec 2:** Evaluate outputs  
- **Dec 3–Dec 6:** Compare results + write analysis  
- **Dec 7–Dec 10:** Submit PR + finalize write-up
