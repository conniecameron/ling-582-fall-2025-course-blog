# Class Competition — Initial Draft Summary  
**Student:** Hari Chandana Vadige  
**Team:** Data Minds

## Task Summary
The purpose of this competition is to determine whether two text spans—joined using the special token `[SNIPPET]`—were written by the **same author (label = 1)** or by **different authors (label = 0)**.  
This is a **binary classification** task related to authorship attribution and stylometry.

The provided dataset includes:
- **train.csv** — contains ID, TEXT, and LABEL  
- **test.csv** — contains ID and TEXT  
- **sample_submission.csv** — example output format  

The `TEXT` field contains two spans merged into one string, where each training example includes the correct binary label.

## Approach (Baseline Model)
For the initial draft stage, our team created a baseline system to generate a valid leaderboard submission.  
I completed the implementation using a **Kaggle Notebook**, which allowed easy dataset upload, training, and reproducible inference.

### Steps performed:
1. Uploaded `train.csv` and `test.csv` to Kaggle.  
2. Loaded the dataset using pandas.  
3. Used **TF–IDF vectorization** with:
   - word n-grams: (1, 2)  
   - character n-grams: (3, 5)  
4. Trained a **Logistic Regression** model with `class_weight="balanced"`.  
5. Used a train/validation split to estimate macro-F1 performance.  
6. Retrained on the full dataset and generated predictions for the test set.  
7. Created `submission.csv` directly in Kaggle and downloaded it for leaderboard upload.

This baseline served as our team's first valid submission.

## Leaderboard Submission
- **Submission name:** `DataMinds`  
- File generated through our Kaggle notebook workflow  
- Evaluated using the **Macro-F1** metric on the hidden test labels
