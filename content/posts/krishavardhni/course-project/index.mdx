# Project Proposal
This project focuses on building multi-label classification system to categorize retail customer complaints into predefined complaint types. 
Since real-world labeled data may be limited, we aim to generate synthetic dataset using a combination of LLM generated data and template 
based techniques. We then explore and compare two methods - embedding based models and transformer based models to analyze their effectiveness 
on this task. We aim to evaluate the model performance and to compare them.


## Project description

# Goals of Final Project:
- Generate a synthetic dataset of retail customer complaints using Large Language Model (LLM) and Template based generation method. The dataset will contain around 1000 rows of data and include realsitic complaints in the categories: product quality issues, delivery and shipping, payment, customer service, website/ app issue or account security.
- Develop a multi label classification system to automatically identify different categories a complaint belongs to.
- Experiment and compare with different statistical NLP approaches focusing separately on embedding-based and transformer-based methods.
- Evaluate the model performance using accuracy, macro F1 score, micro F1 score and classification report. 

# Rough Timeline:
- Week 1 (Oct 27 - Oct 31):
  Collaborate as a Team
  Exploring different ideas for course project
- Week 2 (Nov 3 - Nov 7):
  Finalised on the idea of project: "Retail Customer Complaint Categorisation Model"
  Exploration on approaches and tools for the project
- Week 3 (Nov 10 - Nov 14):
  Define complaint categories 
  Explore LLM options for synthetic data generation
  Generate partial dataset and test the approach using basic classifier model
- Week 4 (Nov 17 - Nov 21):
  Generate full synthetic dataset
  Perform data preprocessing - normalization, encoding labels, handling duplicates or null values
  Perform Exploratory Data Analysis - Analysing distributions of complaints
- Week 5 (Nov 24 - Nov 28):
  Implement Baseline Statistical models
  Implement embedding-based models
  Evaluate and compare performace on the task for both the approaches
- Week 6 (Dec 1 - Dec 5):
  Analyze results and summarise findings in the report 
  Submit final project and push final code to GitHub
