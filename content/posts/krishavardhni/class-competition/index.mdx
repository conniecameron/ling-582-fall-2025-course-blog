## Approach

Draft approach:
My approach to the problem was I split the text into 2 spans using the [SNIPPET] delimiter
and then I extracted few features which would help with similarity matching like punctuation usage, stopword ratios, vocabulary overlap. I then computed the TF-IDF word and 
characters n-gram representations using this I computed the cosine similarity and euclidean distance
for both a and b span texts. These TF-IDF values are given as inputs to my machine learning models. I experimented with Logistic Regression and XGBoost models.
For the final submission I plan on enhancing this classification by using deep learning models like LSTM and transformer based architectures. If needed also use hyperparameter tuning."
