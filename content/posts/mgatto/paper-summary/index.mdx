## Description

This paper describes a project in Germany which explores metaphores in both religious and secular literatures. Here, the authors used NLP methods to process a corpus of pre-digitized Arabic texts from Jordan. These texts are commentaries on the Qur'an, the sacred text of Islam. They deployed these methods to explore the metaphor of, "The Straight Path" and the words used by various commentators while explaining verses in which this phrase occurs. The paper is noteworthy for its application of NLP to Arabic text.

This paper's data repository at https://zenodo.org/records/11206706 has only 41 views as of the time of this commit. It is a highly specialized paper appealing to a very small audience of scholars in Religious Studies or the Digital Humanities and has not been widely remarked upon.

## Motivation

I selected this paper because it was suggested to me by my friend in UA's MENAS department, Dr. Scott Lucas. He wanted me to explain and evaluate the usefulness of their technique. The paper relates to my long-time interest in sacred languages (theolinguistics?), specifically the linguistic aspects of exegetical texts in various Islamicate languages.
