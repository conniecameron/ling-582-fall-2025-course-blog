## Description

_In your own words, what is this paper about?_

Generally few people tend to share updates or information regarding their health or any health experiences on social media platforms like twitter, and this data is taken into consideration to extract broad public health trends from these posts. 
They have mentioned that the existing methods that were used lacked better accuracy and a clear explanations for how conclusions are drawn. 
For this, authors have introduced a framework called ALEX, which makes the analysis of those posts more accurate and also adds an explainable step using Large language models, so that the result is easier to trust. 
In simple words, this paper shows how NLP and deep learning tools can turn everyday online conversations into useful insights.


## Motivation

_Why did you select this paper?_

I have always wondered how broad health trends are identfied from social media posts, and this paper helps me understand it. 
This paper shows how the people regularly share symptoms, concerns, and health experiences online which creates a valuable public health signals to find trends. 
The ALEX framework which they have used not only improves the accuracy of analyzing the posts made but also adds an explainable step using large language models, making the results more trustworthy. 
It mixes my interest in NLP, deep learning, and public health, and shows how technology can turn everyday online conversations into helpful health information.
