## Project description

_See [the rubric](https://parsertongue.org/courses/snlp-2/assignments/rubrics/course-project/final/#reproducibility).  Use subsections to organize components of the description._

For my project, I'm interested in exploring machine translation between Tajik and English. My goal for this project, I'd like to compare performance of a long short term memory (LSTM) model and newer transformer-based model like mBART. Knowledge is not only in the form of english, but also in the crevaces of all languages. Tajik is a low resource language with limited datasets and research, so I want to see how well neural networks could perform to translate between these two languages. We'll not only see the translation performance, but also the challenges that arise when working with low-resource languages.

## Plan of work

Week 1 (Nov. 17-21) - Data Collection and Preprocessing

Week 2 (Nov. 24-28) - Model Implementation and Training (RNN and Transformer)

Week 3 (Dec. 1-5) - Containerization, Evaluation (BLEU and ROUGE scores), Analysis, and Report

Final Days (Dec. 6-7) - Polishing Report and Final Submission

## Data

Tajik to English translation dataset

This data consists of questions and answers translated in both Tajik and English. The dataset is derived from the GSM8K dataset, containing  grade school math problems and their solutions.
