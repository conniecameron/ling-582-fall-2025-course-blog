## Description

_In your own words, what is this paper about?_

Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) is a novel approach to pre-training language representations using deep bidirectional transformers from unlabeled text. BERTs approach differed from Open AI GPT's (Radford et al., 2018) unidirectional training, BERT was trained to consider both left and right context. There was novelty in the pre-training tasks using two unsupervised tasks; BERT used Masked Language Modeling (MLM) and Next Sentence Prediction (NSP). MLM randomly masks a word, then predicts the masked word based on the context. NSP predicts when sentences follow eachother when considering sentence pairs. For fine-tuning BERT, we add additional outpu layers to the pre-trained model and adjust the parameters using labeled data from downstream tasks. BERT revealed that deep bidirectional architectures are more powerful than its unidirecitonal counterparts, this method achieved significant improvements on NLP tasks such as language inference and question answering.

## Motivation

_Why did you select this paper?_

I selected this paper because BERT had a significant impact on the field of NLP, introducing a transformer architecture that enabled contextual understanding in language models. The bidrectional approach of BERT allowed meaning of words to be captured based on the surrounding context. I'm extremely fascinated by the fact that we can train many languages simultaneously and achieve above average performance on lower resource languages. I believe that all technologies should be accessible to everyone, not just english speakers, and BERT was a major step in that direction (pun intended). This is a cornerstone in modern NLP, that most certainly influence many subsequent models and research in the field of multilingual natural language processing.
