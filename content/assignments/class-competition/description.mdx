# Task

Given two spans of text, determine if both spans were produced by the same author.

## Notes
- You are not given the name/ID of either span's author
- You are free to supplement the provided training data
- Both spans are authored in English
- Span length varies
- Spans are joined by the `[SNIPPET]` delimiter
- This task relates to [author profiling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Author_profiling), digital stylometry, and authorship identification

## Requirements
- Your solution should be reproducible and make use of **open source/open weight** models and tools
  - i.e., Open AI API and models can only be used for dataset augmentation

## Labels
This is presented as a binary classification problem.  Classify the documents into one of the following categories:

0: Not the same author
1: Same author


## Instructions

While you are encouraged to engineer features, you may use any classification algorithm and supplemental data that you like.

## Dataset

The majority of data comes from [Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org/).

... supplemented with data aggregated and preprocessed from a variety of other sources 😈
